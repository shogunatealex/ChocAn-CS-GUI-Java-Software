In 150 words argue why our design is "good".

When designing computer programs cohesion refers to how well the class is focused on 
its specific actions and coupling refers to how multiple modules are dependent on each
other. The goal is to keep cohesion high to make the program maintainable and to also 
keep coupling low enough that a single module can be changed without greatly effecting
other modules. In our program, even though there are a lot of classes where each one
has its distinct function there is limited interaction between them. Each class 
interacts with only a few others. We do not have classes that have multiple unrelated
functions, which helps us to keep cohesion high. The issue with coupling is that
when you have coupling you want to make sure it is meaningful to the purpose of 
your program. Though coupling exists in our design we have made sure it is meaningful.
